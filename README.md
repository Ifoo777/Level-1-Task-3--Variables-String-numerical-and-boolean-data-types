# Level 1 Task 3 -Variables: String, numerical and boolean data types

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Create a JavaScript file called myVariables.js.

● Create the following variables with the correct data types (as indicated by
their names) as their values. You can choose the values themselves:
myFirstNumber, mySecondNumber, myFirstString, mySecondString and
myBoolean.

● Output the result of multiplying the two numerical variables.

● Concatenate the two strings and output the result.

● Using template literals, output a multiline string which might read as
follows:
The boolean is: true
The first number is: 6
The second number is: 5
6 x 5 = 30
The first string is: This is my first string.
The second string is: This is my second string!
These two together make: This is my first string. This is my
second string!

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task, you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user. If you need a refresher on how to do this, go back to the example.js
and index.html files in your Task 2 folder for a refresher.

● Create a JavaScript file called fortuneTeller.js.

● You are going to create a fortune teller based on information that you
receive from the user. You need to ask for the following information:

1. The user’s mother’s first name

2. The name of the street they grew up on

3. Their favourite colour as a child

4. Their current age

5. A number between 1 and 10

● With this information, you can work out the following:

a. (5) is the number of years in which they will meet their best friend.

b. Their best friend’s name will be (1) + (2).

c. (4) divided by (5) (rounded off) is the number of years in which they
will get married. (Hint: look up Math.round())

d. The remainder of (4) divided by (5) is how many children they will
have.

e. (4) minus (5) is in how many years they will dye their hair (3).

● Output the result of the above in a multiline string. For example, the output
may be:

In 7 years you are going to meet your best friend named Mary
Washington.
You will get married in 4 years and have 6 children.
In 20 years you are going to dye your hair blue.
